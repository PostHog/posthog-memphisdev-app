# Memphis Export

Publish events to Memphis, an alternative to traditional message brokers.

Memphis is a simple cloud-native message broker which enables you to build modern, 
queue-based applications. Intended for data-orientated developers and data engineers, 
Memphis is ideal for building applications which require large volumes of streamed and enriched data.

This app enables you to publish events from PostHog to a Memphis station (topic) upon ingestion.
